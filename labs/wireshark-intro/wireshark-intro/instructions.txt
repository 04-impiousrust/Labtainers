Title: Wireshark PCAP Analysis Lab Exercise

1. Background

This lab introduces analysis of PCAP files using the
wireshark tool.  You will analyze an existing PCAP, looking
for a specific invalid login attempt.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    start.py pcapanalysis

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions and a terminal connected to a 
computer that contains the PCAP of interest.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

3.1. Run wireshark to perform PCAP Analysis

    a. Start a wireshark:
       wireshark
    b. Open 'telnet.pcap' file:
           File->Open
           select the 'telnet.pcap' file then click Open

3.2. Search for the packet containing the invalid user "john" password inside a telnet data

    Locate the single frame which contains the password provided when the user
    attempted to login as the "john" user. 

    Note: one way is to apply telnet.data filter

    Save the specified packet/frame as 'invalidpassword.pcap'.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stop.py pcapanalysis

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
