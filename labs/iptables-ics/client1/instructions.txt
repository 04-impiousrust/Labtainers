Title: Using iptables To Control ICS Traffic 

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise illustrates the use of iptables
to limit network access to a PLC. This control is enforced by 
a component serving as a firewall.

You will configure the firewall within this topology:

  Client 1 <----> firewall <-----> PLC 
                    ^
                    | 
                    |
  Client 2 <--------*

The firewall only allows the following traffic:

* Client 1 can only access the PLC via SSH and HTTP.
* Client 2 can only access the PLC via MODBUS TCP.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Linux host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    ./start.py iptables

The resulting virtual terminals will include a display of
these instructions, and bash shells on three components:
two client computers and a "firewall".

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

The iptables utility is installed on the "firewall" component.
Use it to prevent the firewall from forwarding any traffic
to the PLC other than SSH and HTTP sessions from Client 1, 
and MODBUS TCP sessions from Client 2.

Demonstrate that you have achieved this by running this command
on Client 1:

    nmap 172.25.0.3

The resulting display should indicate that SSH, HTTP, and MODBUS TCP are
the only ports that are open.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    ./stop.py iptables

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
