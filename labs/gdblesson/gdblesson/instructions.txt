Title: GDB Lesson

1. Background

This lab provides a simple introduction to the use
of the gdb utility to debug a C program.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    start.py gdblesson

The resulting virtual terminals will include a display of
these instructions, and a bash shell.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

Perform the tasks described:
  
a) List the the files in the directory. Use the "less 
sampleMath.c" to view the program. After looking the program over 
contemplate what the result of the program will be. Once you
have done this, type "q" to exit "less". Next, type the
'gcc' command into the shell as follows:
	gcc -g sampleMath.c -o sampleMath

b) This will compile "sampleMath.c" and create an executable of the program
called "sampleMath".  To run the program type 
"./sampleMath". Note the error it throws. 

Rather than looking at the C program alone, the program GDB will 
help us analyse what is throwing an exception. Type
"gdb sampleMath" into the command line.

c) Once the program begins type 'r' or 'run' to starting 
running the program. You will see that there is an 
"Arithmatic exception" at the end of the program. To
better under stand the source of the problem, list the 
contents of the program using the 'l' or 'list' command. 
To repeat a command without having to re-type
anything, just hit the return/enter key; doing this for 
the 'list' command will display the next ten lines of code. 
Look at the code and figure out what line
the while-loop begins on. Type 'break #' where "#" is the
corresponding line number.

Use the 'run' command again. Use the 'p' or 'print' command to display the
value of any variable, just type its name after 'p'/'print'. Type 's' or 'step'
to continue running one line through the program. Periodically print the value
of of num until you see it reach zero. Once you realize what this issue with
the code is type "q" to quit gdb.  Then edit the source code
of the program, e.g., with "nano" or "vi", change the while-loop 
condition to compare with the correct variable. Finally, 
execute the program.   

d) Compile "sampleMath2.c" into "sampleMath2" using gcc. Execute the
program by typing "./sampleMath2"; notice the message it gives you then 
pass it an argument in that range by typing it after the name of the program
and separated by a space. Clearly the program is not running as it is intended,
given the values are different than expected. Once again, GDB is a useful for 
for isolating what is going wrong with a program. Use the 'gdb' command to open
up "sampleMath2".

e) Run the program once using "r #" wherein the symbol '#' is the value of
what parameter is being fed into the program for testing. Set a breaking point
somewhere in the code and step through it. Print variables and try to figure out
what value is causing the incorrect results. When you find out what needs to be
changed, modify the code, and input 342 into it.   

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stop.py gdblesson

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.sh
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
