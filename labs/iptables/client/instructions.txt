Title: Using iptables To Limit Application Services

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise illustrates the use of iptables
to limit which application services, (ports), will
be forwarded through a component serving as a firewall.

You will configure the firewall within this topology:

  client <====> router <=====> server

such that the client can only access ssh and http
services on the server.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Linux host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    ./start.py iptables

The resulting virtual terminals will include a display of
these instructions, and bash shells on two components:
a client computer and a "firewall".

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

The iptables utility is installed on the "firewall" component.
Use it to prevent the firewall from forwarding any traffic
to the server other than ssh and http sessions.

Demonstrate that you have achieved this by running this command
on the client:

    nmap 172.25.0.3

The resulting display should indicate that ssh and http are
the only ports that are open.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    ./stop.py iptables

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
