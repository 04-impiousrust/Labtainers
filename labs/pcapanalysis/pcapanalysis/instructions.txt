Title: PCAP Analysis Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise illustrates parameterization support
including a specific PCAP file for each student.

A previously captured packets using tcpdump is stored as a PCAP file
in the home directory. The traffic packets are the transmission captured
between a client-server using telnet.

Students performing this exercise will transfer the parameterized PCAP file
and analyze the PCAP file to identify the time when the attempted 'break-in',
i.e., incorrect password is submitted.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    ./start.py pcapanalysis

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions, a terminal connected to a client, and a
terminal connected to a server.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

3.1. Run tshark to perform PCAP Analysis

    tshark -T json -r tcpdump.telnet.pcap

3.2. Identify the 'break-in' time 

Identify the time when the attempted 'break-in', i.e., incorrect password is submitted.

Submit the date and time when the attempted 'break-in' to instructor.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    ./stop.py telnetlab

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
