Title: PCAP Analysis Lab Exercise

1. Background

This lab introduces analysis of PCAP files using the
Tshark tool.  You will analyze an existing PCAP, looking
for a specific invalid login attempt.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    ./start.py pcapanalysis

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions and a terminal connected to a 
computer that contains the PCAP of interest.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

3.1. Run tshark to perform PCAP Analysis

    a. To see various options available for tshark, do:
       man tshark

    b. Sample tshark command to display specific fields:
       tshark -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e telnet.data -r telnet.pcap


3.2. Display the single packet containing the invalid "admin" password

    Locate the single frame which contains the password provided when the user
    attempted to login as the "admin" user. 

    Use tshark to display just this frame by using the "-Y frame.number==N" 
    option, where "N" is the frame number.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    ./stop.py pcapanalysis

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
