Title: Telnet Lab Exercise

1. Background

This lab exercise illustrates the use of a telnet client to
access resources on a server.  It is a simple lab intended
to test Labtainer networking.

This lab exercise consists of the following tasks:
    a. Telnet to telnet server and display a file on the server

This instruction file displayed when the lab is started using
the "./start.py telnetlab" command.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.


2. Performing Lab Tasks

The start.py script will have opened three virtual terminals:
the one displaying this file, one on a client and one on the server.
You will invoke the telnet program on the client to interact with the
server.

2.1. Determine the server IP address
In the server window, type "ifconfig" to view the IP address of the server.
The server IP address will follow the "inet adddr:" label.

2.2. Telnet to telnet server and display a file on the server

Use the telnet command to access the server using its IP address:

    telnet <ip>

You will be prompted for a user ID at a login prompt, and then a password.
Both of them are: "ubuntu".

There is a pre-created file on the server named 'filetoview.txt'.

View the file content by doing a 'cat filetoview.txt'.


2.3. Stop the Labtainer

From your host Labtainer work directory, type:
    ./stop.py telnetlab.

This will stop the Labtainer and identify the local host directory
into which results are copied.

Send these results to the instructor.
