Title: Deny Hosts Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise explores the use of denyhosts to
block failed SSH login attempts from a client computer to
an SSH server.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    start.py sshlab

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions, a terminal connected to a client,
and a terminal connected to a server.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

3.1. Login to SSH server from the client with correct password

3.2. Login to SSH server from the client with incorrect password

     Repeat the attempts to login from client with incorrect password
     Display the content of /etc/hosts.deny

     After how many failed attempts does the client's IP address,
     is added to the /etc/hosts.deny

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stop.py sshlab

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
