Title: One-Way Hash Function and MAC Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise explores one way hash functions.
It is derived from the lab described in Crypto_Hash.pdf found at
www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/cryptography.html

These lab instructions augment that Crypt_Hash.pdf
manual.  Perform the tasks describe in these instructions
and refer to that manual and other resources, e.g., course
notes and lectures, to learn about one way hashes.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    start.py onewayhash

The resulting virtual terminals will include a display of
these instructions, and a bash shell.  The openssl package
and other software described in Crypo_Hash.pdf are pre-installed
on the system.  

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

Perform the tasks described in Crypto_Hash.pdf, augmenting
those instructions as follows:
  
Task 1: Generate hashes for the file named: "filetodigest.txt".
And, note that the man pages for openssl has an 
incorrect list of hash algoriths.  You'll see the correct 
list if you attempt to use an incorrect name.

Task 2: Generate keyed hashes for the file named: "filetodigest.txt"

Task 3: Create a file named "edit-this-file.txt" and populate it with
any text.  Generate hashes per the task description.  Edit the file
using hexedit, i.e.,:
    hexedit edit-this-file.txt
and then generate the hashes again per the task description.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stop.py onewayhash

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
