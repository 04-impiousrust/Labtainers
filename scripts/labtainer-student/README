README for Labtainers trunk/scripts/labtainters-student

This is the Labtainers workspace from which all student
labs are started using:

    ./start.py <labname>

Lab testing should use:
 
    ./redo.py <labname>

Note however that redo.py will wipe out all previous state
within containers.

Use

    ./stop.py <labname>

to stop a lab and collect its results.  Note, it is
good practice to stop labs before transitioning to
new labs or to instructor instances, otherwise there
may be networking name conflicts.
