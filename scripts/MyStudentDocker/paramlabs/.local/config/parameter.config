# NOTE:
# 1. This file is invoked only once during creation of the container
# 2. This will parameterize the container specific to each student
# 3. The 'ParameterParser.py' will be called by start.sh script

#
# entry format will depend on the first <operator>
# <operator> - must be either: 'RAND_REPLACE', 'HASH_CREATE', or 'HASH_REPLACE'
#
# 'RAND_REPLACE' entry format:
# RAND_REPLACE : <filename> : <token> : <LowerBound> : <UpperBound>
#     where: <filename> - specifies the filename (file must exist)
#                         where <token> is to be replaced
#            <token> - is the string to be replaced
#            <LowerBound> and <UpperBound> specifies the lower and upper bound
#                                          to be used by random generator
#
# 'HASH_CREATE' entry format:
# HASH_CREATE : <filename> : <string>
#     where: <filename> - specifies the filename (create file if not exist)
#            <string> - this string will be used along with the user's e-mail
#                       as the secret keyed hash for the lab instance seed
# 
# 'HASH_REPLACE' entry format:
# HASH_REPLACE : <filename> : <token> : <string>
#     where: <filename> - specifies the filename (file must exist)
#                         where hash <token> is to be replaced
#            <string> - this string will be used as the secret keyed hash
#
# example:
#

# The following are meant for format string vulnerability lab
RAND_REPLACE: /home/ubuntu/vul_prog.c : SECRET1_VALUE : 100 : 200
# Above entry means randomly replace the token string "SECRET1_VALUE" found in
# file vul_prog.c with a number ranging from 100 to 200

HASH_CREATE : /home/ubuntu/.seed : formatstringinstance
# Above entry means a file named /home/ubuntu/.seed will be created (if it does not exist)
# The 'start.sh' script will prompt the user for his e-mail address and that e-mail
# address along with the string 'formatstringinstance' in this case to create
# a hash to be stored in /home/ubuntu/.seed file

HASH_REPLACE : /root/.secret : ROOT_SECRET : mysupersecretrootfile
HASH_REPLACE : /home/ubuntu/.secret : UBUNTU_SECRET : mysupersecretubuntufile
# Above entries specify /root/.secret and /home/ubuntu/.secret will have its corresponding
# token replaced with hash generated from combining the secret string and lab instance seed
