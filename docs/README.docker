File: README.docker
Description: Give direction related to Docker.

Instruction to install Docker can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

But I have created a bash script 'installDocker.sh'.
Run the script, './installDocker.sh'

Note: the script will call for reboot at the end.
