The framework has not yet been adapted to use Linux package managers.
Currently, scripts are run from a workspace directory and python
paths are managed relatively between scripts.  

Student scripts, e.g., start.py, run from the trunk/scripts/labtainer-student directory.
That directory also contains the labutils.py, which contains most of the framework
functions.

When a student container is first started "docker exec" is used
to run parameterize.sh on the container.

That script also invokes hookBash.sh, which adds the bash
sdtin/stout capturing hook, and adds the startup.sh call
into the .profile.

The startup.sh scripts differ between instructor and student.  The latter
displays instructions.txt.  The former runs grading.
The startup.sh uses a lock to control which
terminal displays the instructions or grading.  In practice, this is done by
an xterm that explicitly runs the startup.sh directly, and thus
the startup.sh invoked by profile.sh typically never does anything.
