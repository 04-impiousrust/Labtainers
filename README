Labtainers README file     May 1, 2017

This is a Labtainers repository containing scripts and data
necessary to construct, run and grade Labtainers labs.

Please refer to the "Labtainers Lab Designer User Guide",
(labdesigner.pdf) for detains on using Labtainers to create
or modify labs.

Quick guide to directories:

   scripts/labtainers-student -- the work directory for running and 
   testing student labs.  You must be in that directory to run 
   student labs.
   
   scripts/labtainers-instructor -- the work directory for 
   running and testing automated assessment and viewing student
   results.
   
   setup_scripts -- scripts for installing Dockers and fixing DNS naming.
   
   docs -- latex source for the labdesigner.pdf, and other documentation.
   
   config -- system-wide configuration settings (these are not the 
   lab-specific configuration settings.

To created new labs you'll want to set an environment variable to this
directory, e.g., 

 export LABTAINER_DIR=`pwd`
