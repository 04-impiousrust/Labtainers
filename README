Release notes at the end of this file.

This is a Labtainers repository containing scripts and data
necessary to construct, run and grade Labtainers labs.

Please refer to the "Labtainers Lab Designer User Guide",
(labdesigner.pdf) for detains on using Labtainers to create
or modify labs.

Quick guide to directories:

   scripts/labtainers-student -- the work directory for running and 
   testing student labs.  You must be in that directory to run 
   student labs.
   
   scripts/labtainers-instructor -- the work directory for 
   running and testing automated assessment and viewing student
   results.
   
   setup_scripts -- scripts for installing Labtainers and Docker and updating Labtainers
   
   docs -- latex source for the labdesigner.pdf, and other documentation.
   
   config -- system-wide configuration settings (these are not the 
   lab-specific configuration settings.

The standard Labtainers distribution does not include files required for development
of new labs.  For those, run ./update-designer.sh from the labtainer directory.

The installation script and the update-designer.sh script set environment variables,
so you may want to logout/login, or start a new bash shell before using Labtainers the
first time.

April 12, 2018
-  Add documentation for the purpose of lab goals, and display this for the instructor
   when the instructor starts a lab.
-  Correct use of the precheck function when the program is in treataslocal, pass capintout.sh
   the full program path.
-  Copy instr_config files at run time rather than during image build.
-  Add Designer Guide section on debugging automated assessment.
-  Incorrect case in lab report file names.
-  Unncessary chown function caused instructor.py to sometimes crash.
-  Support for automated testing of labs (see SimLab and smoketest).
-  Move testsets and distrib under trunk
  
April 5, 2018
-  Revise Firefox profile to remove "you've not use firefox in a while..." message.
-  Remove unnessary pulls from registry -- get image dates via docker hub API instead.

March 28, 2018
-  Use explicit tar instead of "docker cp" for system files (Docker does
   not follow links.) 
-  Fix backups lab use separate file system and update the manual.

March 26, 2018
-  Support for multi-user modes (see Lab Designer User Guide).
-  Removed build dependency on the lab_bin and lab_sys files. Those are now copied
   during parameterization of the lab.
-  Move capinout.sh to /sbin so it can be found when running as root.

March 21, 2018
-  Add CLONE to permit multiple instances of the same container, e.g., for 
   labs shared by multiple concurrent students.
-  Adapt kali-test lab to provide example of macvlan and CLONE
-  Copy the capinout.sh script to /sbin so root can find it after a sudo su.

March 15, 2018
-  Support macvlan networks for communications with external hosts
-  Add a Kali linux base, and a Metasploitable 2 image (see kali-test)

March 8, 2018
-  Do not require labname when using stop.py
-  Catch errors caused by stray networks and advise user on a fix
-  Add support for use of local apt & yum repos at NPS

February 21, 2018
-  Add dmz-lab
-  Change "checklocal" to "precheck", reflecting it runs prior to the command.
-  Decouple inotify event reporting from use of precheck.sh, allow inotify
   event lists to include optional outputfile name.
-  Extend bash hook to root operations, flush that bash_history.
-  Allow parameterization of start.config fields, e.g., for random IP addresses
-  Support monitoring of services started via systemctl or /etc/init.d
-  Introduce time delimeter qualifiers to organize a timestamped log file into
   ranges delimited by some configuration change of interest (see dmz-lab)

February 5, 2018
-  Boolean values from results.config files are now treated as goal values
-  Add regular expression support for identifying artifact results.
-  Support for alternate Docker registries, including a local test registry for testing
-  Msc fixes to labs and lab manuals
-  The capinout monitoring hook was not killing child processes on exit.
-  Kill monitored processes before collecting artifacts
-  Add labtainer.wireshark as a baseline container, clean up dockerfiles

January 30, 2018
-  Add snort lab
-  Integrate log file timestamps, e.g., from syslogs, into timestamped results.
-  Remove undefined result values from intermediate timestamped json result files.
-  Alter the time_during goal assessment operation to associate timestamps with 
   the resulting goal value.

January 24, 2018
-  Use of tabbed windows caused instructor side to fail, use of double quotes.
-  Ignore files in _tar directories (other than .tar) when determining build
   dependencies.
