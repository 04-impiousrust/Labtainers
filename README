This is a Labtainers repository containing scripts and data
necessary to construct, run and grade Labtainers labs.

Please refer to the "Labtainers Lab Designer User Guide",
(labdesigner.pdf) for detains on using Labtainers to create
or modify labs.

Quick guide to directories:

   scripts/labtainers-student -- the work directory for running and 
   testing student labs.  You must be in that directory to run 
   student labs.
   
   scripts/labtainers-instructor -- the work directory for 
   running and testing automated assessment and viewing student
   results.
   
   setup_scripts -- scripts for installing Labtainers and Docker and updating Labtainers
   
   docs -- latex source for the labdesigner.pdf, and other documentation.
   
   config -- system-wide configuration settings (these are not the 
   lab-specific configuration settings.

The standard Labtainers distribution does not include files required for development
of new labs.  For those, run ./update-designer.sh from the labtainer directory.

The installation script and the update-designer.sh script set environment variables,
so you may want to logout/login, or start a new bash shell before using Labtainers the
first time.
